Welcome to my technical ramblings blog. My name is __Adrian Scripcă__, also known as _benishor_ in online communities. I am located in [România](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania) and my interests lay in demoscene, programming, game development, web development, electronics and ham radio.

I have a passion for code and design, be it for enterprise solutions or embedded devices. I don't know _everything_ but I can surely learn a lot.

I currently work for [iQuest](http://www.iquestgroup.com/) as a Senior Software Engineer.
